# Rebol port of Perl's gather/take 

## Why?

* Allow me to learn more Rebol!

* Experiment in playing with code as data

* Learn r3 modules

* Yet make it work r2 & r3 compatible

* Lesson on working around caveats (see next bit)

* Look into packaging and test mini-suite (methinks)


## Caveats

* Rebol3 comes with a *take* function


## See Also

* collect/keep functions from Power-mezz: http://www.rebol.it/power-mezz/mezz/collect.r

* Different approach used between collect/keep & gather/take

* And since implemented I've noticed that Rebol3 has collect/keep also!! :(

* ... and t uses approach closer but not identical to mine :)

* Pro & Cons of different approaches?
